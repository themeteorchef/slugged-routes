#### The Meteor Chef
#### \#006 - Slugged Routes

In this recipe we'll help Command Module, a spacecraft design blog, add pretty permalinks to their blog. We'll learn about Meteor's new Template.subscribe method as well as Template.subscriptionsReady helper. We'll also make use of Iron Router's `data` option to pull blog posts out of our database and play with JavaScript's `regExp` and `replace` to sanitize our post titles.
